        <h4>Suicide or Murder?</h4>
 
            There once was a rich man from Leeds<br />
            Who had everything any man needs<br />
            Including a wife<br />
            And a very sharp knife<br />
            Which <strong><em>she</em></strong> used and now
            <strong><em>his</em></strong> heart bleeds
